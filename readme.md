# [Socket.IO 2][3] [example][1]

- Official Git [repo][2]

## Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone - connects or disconnects
- Add support for nicknames
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon - as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- Show who’s online
- Add private messaging
- Share your improvements!
